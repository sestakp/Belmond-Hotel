# Belmond Hotel

Web-based information system created within the Advanced Information Systems course at BUT FIT in the Master's programme. It is a hotel management system where reservations can be made, rooms can be added, and problems with cleaning staff can be solved. Users can create reviews here. The frontend is written in React.JS and the backend runs Jakarta.EE.
